# CS-330-Programming-Lang-Project
This repository is to learn and successfully code in the programming language C++.

## History & Creation
C++ is a programming language which was created by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an extension of the programming language - C.

**Milestone**
- 1998: The first standardized version of C++.
- 2011: Introduced lambda expressions, smart pointers, and multithreading.
- 2014 and 2017: Simplified syntax and enhanced libraries.
- 2020: Added concepts, coroutines, and improved modular programming.

## Programming Development 
C++ does not come with any primary recommended programming environment. Progammers in our day and age use Integrated development environments like 
Visual Studio Code(Microsoft), CLion(JetBrains), and more

I'll be using _VS Code_ because I'm familiar with the software application, it's free of cost, beginner-friendly, highly compatible
with MacOS, and provides an official Microsoft C/C++ extention.

## Gettin Started (set-up) 
**_Installing Process_**

**For MacOs, you have to open your terminal and run the following command:**
```
xcode-select --install
```

**After you're done, check to see if it successfully worked or not by running this command:**
```
clang++ --version
```

**If it worked, your screen should show something like:**
```
Apple clang version 17.0.0 (clang-1700.0.13.5)
```
